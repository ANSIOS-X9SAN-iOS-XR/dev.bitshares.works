## How to Request or Contribute for BitShares Documentation Project


This is our first step. We would like to start using this step to collaborate with the BitShares Community. 

BitShares has great communities (Telegram, Discord, etc) to support others. More new developers join the BitShares Community, more the same type of questions might be asked and answered. (We've understood that the BitShares Documentation needs to be improved and updated.) 

While reading different media threads, we often see people are searching the same resources that someone else had asked before. We know many BitShares developers have own repositories or resources to share/contribute but often other developers (especially new developers) don't know the existence or where to find. 

The Core Team are here to improve and update the BitShares Core documentation and also provide a place for the BitShares Community members' contributions. We locate all over the world, many contributed information are hidden or just we do not know. Hope this our first step supports BitShares developers' contributions together and the BitShares Community to grow.
